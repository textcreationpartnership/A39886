            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is ſo much contrary to my natural Genius to study politeneſs of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or Rhetorical Flouriſhes of Words, that I could never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with to print any of my poor Lucubrations in this critical and learned Age; and I had been ſilent now alſo, as all along hitherto, had I not been highly provoked by a Neighbour, <hi>John Elliot,</hi> who hath been pleaſed to proclaim his own Weakneſs, to ſay no worſe, to the World, in a ſmall Piece, entituled, <hi>The Saving Grace of God.</hi> This he will have to be in all Men, yea, and nothing leſs than an <hi>Increated Being;</hi> and, becauſe I offered him a few Arguments to the contrary, he hath been in a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of <hi>furious Zeal</hi> againſt me, and his Spirit in ſo great a Ferment, that he hath repreſented me as <hi>groſly Erroneous,</hi> and a <hi>notorious Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,</hi> preſſing Perſons moſt vehemently to withdraw from me, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue their Attendance on my Miniſtry. I can truly ſay, It is not the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of mine own Honour that hath prompted me thus to put Pen to Paper; for I do really look upon my ſelf as a poor inconſiderable Nothing, that my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Diſhonour is little to be regarded; only I would not willingly hear of this at the Great Day, that while I ſlept the <hi>Tares</hi> were not only ſowed, but alſo grew up. I could gladly be ſilent, ſo my Silence were not ſinful. Happily ſome of my Learned and Prudent Brethren may cenſure me for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cognizance of, or medling with ſo weak an Antagoniſt; but I humbly take leave to acquaint them, that they may not know all the Circumſtances of this Caſe; therefore they may reſt ſatisfied, that I have not acted herein without what is unto me an Authentick Call thereunto. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Servetus,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Fatuitas dogmatum ſecurum me reddidit,</hi> the fooliſhneſs of his Opinions made him regardleſs; but he ſaw Cauſe afterwards to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of his ſleep and ſecurity, upon the coming out of this crude, indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, empty Script of <hi>J. E.</hi> There was ſuch inſulting and triumphing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Quakers, as if the Day had been everlaſtingly their own in this Place; Copies were with great diligence ſcattered up and down in moſt Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:46828:3"/>with us: My Ears were filled from day to day of my being ſo conquered, that I must never hold up my Head any more; nothing leſs was expected, than that moſt of our Friends would quickly be proſelyted to <hi>J. E.</hi>'s Opinion and Way. Some well meaning perſons, no way inclined to Quakeriſm, could not tell what to think of it; that Grace which had been ſo honourably ſpoken of in all Ages, ſhould be no more but a meer Creature. By theſe and other weighty Conſiderations, I was alarmed and influenced to what I apprehended was my Duty, willing to obſerve that Apoſtolical Canon, <hi>1 Cor. 14.26. Let all things be done unto edifying,</hi> I was loth to trouble the People, or pollute the Pulpit with Replies to the Impertinencies of <hi>J. E</hi>'s. Scribble, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that as diſtinct from this, which I purpoſe alſo to publiſh if I have any freſh Provocation: The way I have been directed to take, was, doctrinally, and practically to diſcuſs this Poſition, That though <hi>Inherent Grace be a great Excellency, yet no Increated Being,</hi> with ſome uſeful Inferences, Deductions, and Corollaries from thence. The Lord hath been graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo far to own and accept of this piece of Service, as to accompany it with a Bleſſing from above, I know not one of the Congregation in Fellowſhip with us, but what are fully ſatisfied in what they have heard; and ſome of the most Judicious among them have, with much importunity preſt, that this may be made as publick as the other was, hoping that others may reap the ſame benefit and advantage by it as they have reap'd, and that it may contribute ſomething towards the preventing of the growth of Quakeriſm in other places as well as here. O, pray, pray, pray that <hi>the Word of the Lord may have free Courſe, and be glorified, 2 Theſſ. 4.1.</hi> Paul <hi>planteth, and</hi> Apollos <hi>watereth; but it is God that giveth the encreaſe, 1 Cor. 3.6.</hi> This may ſerve both as an Apology for my appearing thus in Print and as a Prefatory Introduction to what enſueth.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HAving an Eye to the Inſtruction, Edification, and Stabliſhing in the Truth thoſe that were my conſtant Auditors, I did not judge it worth while, all along to diſpute againſt that which is called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Grace</hi> in <hi>All;</hi> I only gave one <hi>Argument</hi> to prove that to be a <hi>non entitie;</hi> there is no ſuch thing in <hi>rerum natura;</hi> it is not what it is called by ſome: But that I might approve my ſelf a <hi>fair Diſputant,</hi> the Task I undertook was this; To prove, that That which is <hi>Saving Grace</hi> in them that are <hi>true Believers,</hi> effectually renewed and ſanctified by the Word and Spirit of God, is no <hi>Increated Being;</hi> and therefore a <hi>Majore ad minus;</hi> much leſs is that which is falſly called <hi>Grace,</hi> the <hi>Spirit, Chriſt, Light,</hi> the <hi>meaſure of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Appearance in All.</hi> This being the principal thing to be inſiſted on, I diſpatched the one <hi>confutatory Argument</hi> with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than a bare mentioning of it, without a large Proſecution; which was this:</p>
            <p>That which is in every Man is in <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>profeſs'd Pagans:</hi> But <hi>the Saving Grace of God</hi> is not in <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>profeſ'd Pagans;</hi> therefore not in every Man.</p>
            <p>It's only the Aſſumption that's to be proved; and that I prove thus; If that which is in <hi>Heathens,</hi> be <hi>nature,</hi> only <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>called nature by God, ſpeaking in his Word, yea, and nature deeply depraved</hi> and corrupted in All, then the <hi>Saving Grace of God is not in Heathens.</hi> The former is true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. and therefore alſo the latter.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Heathens</hi> and all <hi>unconverted Perſons</hi> are <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> Aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and without God in the Word, then that which is in them is not Chriſt. The former is true, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. Therefore alſo the latter.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Heathens,</hi> conſidered Antecedently to the Goſpel's being preached to them, do <hi>ſit in darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>in the ſhadow of death, having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their Heart;</hi> then that which is in them is meer Darkneſs, and no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Light, they can know nothing of Evangelical Verities, and whatever is of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation from any thing within themſelves. The former is true, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.79. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. Therefore alſo the latter.</p>
            <p>If that which is in <hi>Heathens</hi> is the <hi>Devil, and the Spirit of the Devil,</hi> then that which is in them, is not the Spirit of God; for, <hi>what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? What Concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. The former is true, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>I call this but one Argument, for it is diverſified only with reſpect to the ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations which <hi>J. E.</hi> gives unto that which is in every Man, without Reſtriction or Limitation: I humbly leave it to thoſe that are impartial, whether this alone is not of ſufficient force, cogency, and validity, utterly to overthrow the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>John</hi>'s Book, and conſequently, whether the whole of the <hi>Superſtructure</hi> is not alſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46828:4"/>therewith overthrown? and whether I deſerved ſuch hard words for calling, not that which is in True Believers, and a ſpecial Work of the ſanctifying Spirit of God, <hi>a great nothing,</hi> but that which is <hi>nominally</hi> only, and equivocally called the <hi>ſaving Grace of God</hi> in All, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahometans, Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans, Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts:</hi> Where Foundation and Superſtructure are both naught, theſe will not be able to bear <hi>the trial by fire,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. But I paſs from this to the diſquiſition of what I have ſeen cauſe chiefly to inſiſt on; which you may take in this categorical Propoſition, Theſis or Poſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſaving Grace of God in True Believers, is no Increated Being. That which is Grace in thoſe that are Chriſtians indeed, is a Creature, a mere Creature, and an imperfect Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For methods ſake, and a regular procedure herein, 1. I ſhall ſet down ſome <hi>Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,</hi> tending to a right <hi>ſtating</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> or the Thing in controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and to the clearing of ſome things ignorantly and confuſedly delivered by the Author of the ſaving Grace of God. 2. It's needful there ſhould be ſome <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or Deſcription given of <hi>Grace;</hi> otherwiſe, we are like Men beating the Air, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of we do not know what. 3. Having given one or two deſcriptive Defintions of Grace, we ſhall by expreſs Scripture Teſtimonies, and Arguments from thence deduced, prove the Theſis, Grace in Believers is no Increated but a Created Being. 4. What is ſaid of this Theme and Subject is to be improved by us; and in order thereunto, I ſhall give you ſome practical Inferences from all the premiſſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Preliminary. There is no Perſon or poſitive Entitie in Heaven or Earth, but what's Created of the Lord Jehova, Father, Son, and Spirit.</hi> Sin being no poſitive Entitie but privative, properly hath no efficient, but rather a deficient Cauſe. This is a Principle, and the Foundation of all Religion, therefore it's the firſt Lecture read from Heaven to us, by him that was the firſt authorized Amanuenſis of the Holy Ghoſt, in Penning ſome Part of the Sacred Oracles. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. See alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24. God made the World and all things therein.</p>
            <p>If Grace be one of thoſe things that's in Heaven or Earth, then it is to be reckoned among the number of Created Beings; but Grace is one of thoſe things that's in Heaven or Earth. Therefore, —</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Preliminary.</hi> follows upon the former. The word <hi>Increate</hi> ſignifieth that which is not created or made at all. Hence the Argument runs thus; If Grace be that which is not created or made at all, it muſt be Self-exiſtent, Independent, the firſt Being and Creator of the Univerſe. But it's not Self-exiſtent, Independent, the firſt Being, nor the Creator of the Univerſe; therefore it's no Increated Being: It's a true ſaying in School Divinity, <hi>omne ens eſt vel Primum vel à primo ortum,</hi> whence if Grace be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create it muſt be the firſt Being from which every other Being derive theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Preliminary.</hi> There is a paſſage in my Opponents Pamphlet, pag. 26. which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo much of unſoundneſs, Heterodoxy, and ſcandalous Ignorance in this our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen</hi> or Land of Light; that I cannot let it paſs without ſome Animadverſion.

There's Divinity for you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Preliminary.</hi> It is a received Principle both in <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy, omne quod recipitur recipitur ad modum recipientis,</hi> when one thing is ſaid to be in another, every ſuch <hi>inexiſtence</hi> is to be underſtood, that it's according to the <hi>receptivity</hi> of the <hi>Receiver:</hi> When <hi>God, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>in Man,</hi> it is in a <hi>ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs</hi> to the <hi>Eſſential Conſtitution</hi> of Man, as a <hi>Rational Being,</hi> having Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Will, and Affections. Chriſt and his Spirit are in Believers to exert and put forth gracious Acts and Operations upon them, as their reſpective exigencies do require, to humble them when they want humbling; to give a check to their corruptions, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them when there is occaſion; to recover them out of the ſnare of the evil one, when entangled therein; to enlighten and enliven, quicken and comfort them; to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate and ſtrengthen them in and under all their Weakneſſes, Infirmities, Troubles,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46828:5"/>Trials, and Temptations. I know there are ſome <hi>magni nominis,</hi> and whom I do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reverence, who have ſaid much for a perſonal Inhabitation of the Spirit in Believers; but I humbly take leave to diſſent from them in this. Thoſe Texts of Scripture that ſpeak of the Spirits being or dwelling in Believers, are not to be underſtood of an Hypoſtatical or Perſonal Union between the Spirit and them, it is purely Myſtical and Spiritual: What Learned <hi>Norton,</hi> Orth. Evang p. 289. 290. ſays of the Union between Chriſt and Believers, both negatively and poſitively, the ſame I may ſay of the Union between the Spirit and them. Negatively, it is not Eſſential, ſuch as is the Union of the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one Eſſence in God; nor Perſonal, ſuch as is the Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in one, and that an Increated Perſon in Chriſt. Not natural, whether Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, as is the Union of the Form with the matter; or by local contract, that is, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural touching one of another, as Water is united to the Veſſel; or by mixture, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is united to Honey; or by the coupling together of common and ſpecial nature, as the Genus is united to the Species; or by coheſion, as when one part of the Body cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with another; or by Adheſion, as when pitch cleaveth to our hands; or by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as when an Accident inhereth in the Subject, it's not Civil, as is the Union of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons into one Body politick. Poſitively, it's a Spiritual Union; in reſpect of the verity thereof, it's real, not imaginary; in reſpect of the things united, it's ſubſtantial; in reſpect of its way and manner, it's ſupernatural and ſecret; in reſpect of the nearneſs of it; it's cloſe and intimate. Some of the reaſons of my diſſent from thoſe that Aſſert a perſonal Inhabitation are theſe.</p>
            <p>If there be a perſonal Inhabitation of the Spirit in Believers, there is alſo a perſonal Inhabitation of the Father and of the Son in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>John</hi> 17.23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The latter is abſurd, therefore alſo the former.</p>
            <p>If the Perſon of the Spirit be in the Perſon of every Individual Believer, then every Individual Believer is two Perſons. The latter is abſurd, therefore the former.</p>
            <p>If the Union between the Spirit and Believers be perſonal, then there are more Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Unions than that of the Divine and Humane Nature, in Chriſt: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture knows no more, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. therefore there are no more.</p>
            <p>Where the Perſon of the Spirit is, there is the Father, Son, and Spirit, for the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is inſeparable from either of the Perſons. The Eſſence of Father, Son and Spirit is not in Believers, therefore not the Perſon of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>If the Perſonal property of the Spirit, which is Proceſſion from the Father and the Son, be inſeparable from the Perſon of the Spirit, then the Perſon of the Spirit is not in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: The former is true, therefore the latter. The reaſon of the connexion of the Major is this: The perſonality of the Spirit was from Eternity, is at this day what it always was, and will be to all Eternity what it hath ever been. The Spirit did, does, and will invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably proceed from the Father and the Son. Where the Perſon of the Spirit is, there muſt be the Perſon of the Father and of the Son. Believers were not from Eternity, and now they have an actual Exiſtence, the Perſon of the Father, nor the Perſon of the Son not being in them, from whom the Spirit does proceed, the conſequence to me is clear, that the Perſon of the Spirit is not in them.</p>
            <p>The Spirit is no otherwiſe in Believers now, than before the Incarnation of Chriſt; I have not heard of any that plead for a Perſonal Inhabitation of the Spirit in Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Believers; and there is no reaſon appears to me why this Privilege ſhould be peculiarly appropriated to us more than to the other. 'Tis true, that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Promiſe of the Father, Act.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>the Promiſe of the Spirit, Joh.</hi> 16.7, 8. was not to have its Accompliſhment, till after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt; but that is to be underſtood of the pouring out of the Spirit in a larger meaſure, and on a far greater number than before, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46828:5"/>
            <p>If the Perſon of the Spirit is in Believers now in the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> either he is ſo in all, or only in ſome. If in all, hath he been ſo in all Ages, from the Incarnation or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt till now, or only in ſome Ages? Does he enter into them when firſt the Work of Regeneration is begun in them, or afterwards? Where he once comes, does he never after recede? If in all, and at all times, how comes it that he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his perſonal Preſence to ſo few all this while? If thus in all, how comes it, that there are ſtill, and have been ſo many perſonal Infirmities and Failings where he takes up his conſtant Reſidence? How comes it, that ſome of them have, in an hour of Temptation, groſly prevaricated, for a time, both in Principles and Practice? If in ſome only, then this is a Priviledge peculiar to thoſe few, and not to others: If ſo, by what Covenant or Promiſe is this Priviledge entailed upon them excluſive of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? or does the purchaſe of Chriſt's Death as to this, extend to them, not to others?</p>
            <p>The greateſt Argument, for what I can perceive, for a perſonal inexiſtence of the Spirit in Believers is, that there are ſo many Texts of Scripture which ſpeaking of this do ſpeak of him as a Perſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God, v.</hi> 26.
<note place="margin">Quo efficitur ut clamemus nos.</note> 
               <hi>The Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groaning, which cannot be uttered</hi>— All I reply hereunto at preſent is this; By the ſame Reaſon alſo there muſt be a perſonal inexiſtence of the Father and the Son in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us,—Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, v.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God—God is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Eaton</hi>'s Arguments againſt a Perſonal In-dwelling of the Spirit in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are of weight with me, <hi>Quakers confuted, p.</hi> 1. 2. <q>We do not believe that there is any ſubſtantial, eſſential, or perſonal Union between this eternal Spirit and Believers; for ſuch Unions would either make the Spirit and Believers ſome Third Thing, as when Soul and Body are united, a Third Thing which is neither Soul nor Body, but compounded of both, ariſeth from it, which is, called Man; or elſe there will be a confounding of Subſtance, which cannot be; for God cannot mix with the Creature: And elſe ſuch Union, if it ſhould be perſonal, as betwixt the two Natures in Chriſt, would make Believers God, and equal with Chriſt; and conſequently equal with God himſelf: the conſequence of which would be, that ſuch Perſons would have an Almighty Power, which they might put forth in working as many Miracles as they pleaſe, as they may ſee it make for the Glory of God; and that they would be Omniſcient, and know all things, and would have the reſt of God's Attributes as Chriſt had, who was God, and equal with God, and in whom this perſonal Union was. And though we believe that the Spirit of Chriſt dwells in Saints, yet we aſſert the Spirit of Chriſt to be diſtinct from the Saints, and the Saints from the Spirit; and though he dwells in them, yet he acts not in them, but as it pleaſeth him; neither doth he impart Wiſdom, Power, Grace, and Glory, but as it pleaſeth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, to 12.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome Paſſages in Mr. <hi>R Sherl.</hi> Diſcourſe of the Holy Spirit, worthy of a Remark, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12. <q>It was the Errour of the <hi>Macedomans</hi> and <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> of old, and of the <hi>Socinians</hi> of late, That by the Spirit of God is meant no other, but <hi>Virtus ſeu efficacia, quâ hommes fideles ſanctificantur &amp; divinis uſibus conſecran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; i. e.</hi> That Vertue or Efficacy, whereby faithful Men are ſanctified and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Divine Offices. And oppoſite to this Extreme, many now-a-days run to the other, miſtaking and miſterming the Efficacies and Vertues of the Spirit for the Perſon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46828:6"/>of the Spirit himſelf: The Holy Orthodox Truth lies betwixt theſe two Extremes— And when you read in Holy Scriptures of being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, or made Partakers of the Spirit of God, it is not to be underſtood of the Spirit in reſpect of his perſonal Eſſence; for thus he filleth the World, and contains all things, being really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent and preſent, in and with all things and Creatures, giving unto All their Life and Breath, and all things; <hi>In whom we live, and move, and have our Being, Act.</hi> 17. <hi>viz,</hi> by his inexiſting Preſence; and this in reſpect of his perſonal Eſſence. If we ſhould ſay then, That the Spirit of God is in his Saints and Servants here upon Earth in a greater meaſure than other Men perſonally, and in reſpect of his Eſſence, we ſhould ſo divide, and conſequently define and limit the Eſſence of God, which is undivided, infinite, and unlimited, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Am I a God at Hand, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himſelf in Secret Places, that I ſhould not ſee him; for do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Thus then thoſe Scripture-Phraſes of <hi>receiving the Holy Ghoſt</hi>—are not to be underſtood of the Spirit, in reſpect of his perſonal Eſſence, but in reſpect of his Impreſſions and Workings on the Souls of Men, in reſpect of his Gifts and Graces, which are various and diverſe, and carry their Name from the Cauſe or Author of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. <hi>There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit;</hi> where the Spirit is plainly diſtinguiſh'd from his Gifts; as the Cauſe from the Effect; the Workman from the Work of his Hands; or as the Body of the Sun from the Light and Heat which is darted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played from it. And whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Spirit is one, but his Gifts diverſe,</hi> we may hence obſerve, That if we ſhould confound the Spirit of God with the Gifts and Qualifications diſpenſed from him, we ſhould be ſo far from worſhipping the true God, which is but One, that we ſhould fall into that groſs Idolatry of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of old, making as many Spirits of God, as they made Gods; who Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the moral Vertues, and worſhipped their ſeveral Vertuous Qualifications, as Gods. Hence it is, that ſome being perſuaded, that they have the Spirit of God perſonally abiding in them, have been puft up with ſuch an exceſſive Spiritual Pride, and ſelf-conceited Eminence, as not only to exalt them ſelves above their Brethren, but even to extol themſelves above the Heavens, and moſt blaſphemouſly to profeſs and boaſt of an equality with God.</q> There was a Teſtimony bore againſt this Principle by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in <hi>New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Preliminary.</hi> The Word <hi>Grace</hi> in the Scripture is of a double Acceptation, there is <hi>Gratia gratum faciens;</hi> which is ſays <hi>Scharp. Curſ.

There is, <hi>Gratia gratis data,</hi> or, <hi>Donum quodvis quod ex gratuito Dei amore &amp; liberalitate in nos confertur.</hi> Any Gift that is beſtowed on us of the Love, Favour, and Bounty of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15, 28. <hi>Let us have Grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, Act.</hi> 11.23. and 13.43. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. and 9.8. The Queſtion is of Grace in this latter Sence; not of Grace in the former Sence. That which is in all Men, is the Saving Grace of God, ſays <hi>J. E.</hi> and an increated Being. That which is in all Men is not Grace, ſay I, nor an Increated Being; yea, that which is true Saving Grace in Believers, is not an Increated Being. Thus I have done with the <hi>Preliminaries.</hi> It is needful in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46828:6"/>next place, that ſome Definition be given of Grace inherent in Believers; for there is nothing elſe in others that deſerves the Denomination of Grace, or is ſo to be called.</p>
            <p>That Grace which hath Man for its Subject of Inheſion may be thus deſcribed: It is a <hi>Supernatural and Special Gift of God, beſtowed upon ſome in and through Chriſt, as Mediator of the New Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call it a <hi>Supernatural Gift,</hi> becauſe it proceeds not; neither can it proceed from <hi>Nature,</hi> as now in its lapſed State. A ſpecial Gift, becauſe not given to all. Faith is one of theſe Graces; and, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2 <hi>All Men have not Faith.</hi> A <hi>Free Gift,</hi> to ſhew that God in diſpenſing <hi>inherent Grace</hi> to Sinners, is not acted by <hi>neceſſity of Nature,</hi> but is a <hi>voluntary Agent;</hi> he might have chuſed whether he would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it on one or another; herein he acts <hi>according to the good Pleaſure of his Will, Eph.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>according to the Riches of his Grace, Eph.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee to differ from another?</hi> or, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> When I ſay, <hi>beſtowed upon ſome,</hi> this implies, that <hi>Grace</hi> in this and the other Man, was a little while ago a <hi>n</hi>

               </gap>ens, that which had no Exiſtence. Hence the Argument runs thus; That which a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e while ago was a <hi>non-entity,</hi> cannot be an Increated Being; ſuch was Grace inherent in this and the other Man. Therefore—</p>
            <p>When I ſay, <hi>beſtowed in and through Chriſt</hi>—it is to diſtinguiſh it from the Bleſſings of a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Common Providence, Pſal.</hi> 33.5. and 119.64. and 145.14, 15, 16. <hi>The Whole Earth is full of the Goodneſs of the Lord; and his tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all his Works:</hi> But this is a <hi>Speciality of Divine Favour,</hi> given only to the Elect <hi>in and through Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. and there are none actually poſſeſs'd thereof, but they that are Members of that Myſtical Body, whereof Chriſt is Head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p>Another Deſcription of Inherent Grace, is this; <hi>It is an eminent Work of the Spirit of God upon the Souls of Sinners, or the preaching of the Goſpel, whereby nature is ſo far renewed in them in reſpect of Qualities, that all old things are done away, and all things are made new, in order to their being in a Capacity to glorifie God here, and their being glorified with him to all Eternity hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a <hi>Work of the Holy Ghoſt, Joh.</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. Hence I argue thus, That which hath the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> for its <hi>Efficient,</hi> is no <hi>Increated</hi> but a <hi>Created Being:</hi> Such is <hi>Grace</hi> in Believers; Therefore—</p>
            <p>I call it an <hi>Eminent Work of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh from other more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Works of his.

            <p>Having gone over the parts of the laſt deſcription of Grace, and glanced at ſome Arguments from thence, grounded on expreſs Scripture teſtimonies, I proceed to ſome other Arguments to prove this Poſition: That Grace in Believers is no increated Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
            <p>If there be ſome <hi>higher Excellencies</hi> than any thing that is <hi>in Believers,</hi> during their <hi>Pilgrimage here;</hi> and yet they are no <hi>increated</hi> but <hi>created Excellencies;</hi> much more muſt any thing that is in them be ſo: The former is true, therefore alſo the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Humane Nature of Chriſt,</hi> is a <hi>greater Excellency</hi> than any thing that is <hi>in Believers:</hi> The <hi>humane Nature of Chriſt</hi> is no <hi>increated Being;</hi> therefore much leſs is any thing that is in Believers ſo. They that deny any thing here muſt be <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Jews;</hi> not ſuch as profeſs the Chriſtian Religion. 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſtery of Godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi> He who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, <hi>came of the Fathers concerning the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9.5.

Luke 1.31, 32, 35. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee; therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> Gal. 4.4 <hi>When the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman</hi> — Heb. 8.2. and 9.11. and 10.5. — <hi>A Body thou haſt prepared for me,</hi>

It is taken into the <hi>

If the Angels of Heaven, with all the Grace they have, be created Beings; then alſo the Sons of Men, with all the Grace they have, are created Beings: The former is true, therefore the latter. I do not know what can be denied; however, I proceed to the proof of what I argue for, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth;</hi> therefore alſo <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>All they are and have,</hi> Gen. 2.1. <hi>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are called the <hi>Hoſts of Heaven,</hi> Pſalm 103.20, 21. and 148.2. Luke 2.13.</p>
            <p>Col. 1.16. <hi>By him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> 38.6, 7. <hi>Whereupon are the foundations of the Earth faſtned, or who laid the corner Stone thereof: When the morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> By theſe muſt be underſtood the Angels; for neither the Stars in the Firmament were created, non Man, when the Foundations of the Earth were faſt'ned: They are called <hi>Stars,</hi> even as ſome Men of Eminency are ſo called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.10. and 12.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.20. and <hi>morning Stars,</hi> for their excellent <hi>Luſter and Glory,</hi> for which they are called <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.14—<hi>Sons of God;</hi> partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had the whole of their Being from God; and partly, becauſe they were <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Glorious Image.</hi> They are ſaid to ſing together—becauſe probably none of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46828:9"/>them having then apoſtatized, they were all of them harmonious in this Heavenly Work of celebrating the Praiſe of their Creator.</p>
            <p>How Glorious ſoever the Angels are in reſpect of their Eſſence and Graces; and though they are Stars of the firſt Magnitude, in compariſon of all in this Sublunary World, yet they are but Creatures, and there is an infinite diſparity between them and the <hi>Increated Being. Job</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>Behold, he put no truſt in his Servants; and his Angels he charged with Folly: How much leſs on them that dwell in Houſes of Clay, whoſe Foundation is in the Duſt, which are cruſhed before the Moth?</hi> God did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> in them: they were liable to Sin, and ſome of them being left to themſelves did actually ſin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6.

There are many things alſo, the Knowledge whereof they acquire by <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Experience:</hi> Taking Cognizance of the <hi>Occurrences</hi> and <hi>Acts of Providence</hi> towards the Church in her Militant State, they learn what they were <hi>ſinleſly ignorant,</hi> or <hi>neſcient</hi> of before, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. Though they are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Creatures, yet they are not Omniſcient, they know not the Day of Judgment, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.32.

            <p>If what Holineſs <hi>Adam</hi> had in the State of Innocency was no <hi>Increated Being,</hi> what Grace Believers have now is no <hi>Increated Being.</hi> The former is true: Therefore — If Grace be as to Subſtance, what Holineſs was in <hi>Adam,</hi> then it remains ſtill what it always was, no Increated, but a Created Excellency—<hi>Eſſentia rerum poſit a eſt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibili,</hi> The Eſſence of things is unalterably the ſame in all Ages. Though Grace, as it is in this and the other Subject may, <hi>recipere majus &amp; minus,</hi> it does admit of different degrees and meaſures in one more than another; yet it is in its nature the ſame in all.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had no Holineſs in him before the Fall, but what was derived from God the Creator, then it was no Increated, but a Created Excellency. The former is true: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>God ſaid, Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeneſs. Adam,</hi> not only conſidered as a Man, was made of God, but alſo as endued with divine Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Image of God and Grace are identical; or at leaſt, Grace is no ſmall part of the Image of God. The <hi>Footſteps</hi> of the Almighty were upon the reſt of this lower Creation; but the <hi>Image of God</hi> was impreſs'd upon Man; by Virtue of which, he did reſemble his Maker for Wiſdom, Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, ſo far as ſuch a Creature was capable to reſemble him. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. are as a Comment on <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. They are an <hi>Exegeſis,</hi> or Explication of it, to ſhew, that it was not the Eſſence of God, or any part of the Eſſence of God, as ſome do ignorantly inſinuate, that was imparted unto Men at firſt; but rather, that he had a Rational and Immortal Soul, embelliſh'd with thoſe divine Qualities, which made him more like unto God, than the meer Animals and inanimate Creatures. <hi>Simile non eſt idem.</hi> That which is like a thing is not the thing it ſelf. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>God made Man upright.</hi> If God did not only make Man himſelf, but alſo his Original Uprightneſs, then Man's Inherent Grace
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46828:10"/>is no Increated, but Created Excellency. The former is true: Therefore — What <hi>Man</hi> is in his <hi>Eſſentials</hi> or <hi>Integrals,</hi> in his <hi>Naturals</hi> or <hi>Supernaturals,</hi> in his <hi>Morals</hi> or <hi>Spirituals,</hi> he is a Creature of God, and nothing more; and whoever ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they neither know God nor themſelves, Nature nor Grace, nor any thing elſe aright.</p>

            <p n="6">6 If the <hi>Glory</hi> which <hi>Believers</hi> are to be made <hi>Partakers</hi> of in <hi>Heaven</hi> be no Increated, but a Created Being, much more what they have here is ſo. The former is true: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grace and Glory are in their nature the ſame; the difference is only gradual; <hi>Grace is Glory in the Bud; Glory is Grace in Perfection.</hi> The Enjoyments of Saints <hi>in vià</hi> and <hi>in patrià</hi> are for <hi>Subſtance</hi> the ſame; only the latter are in a far <hi>larger meaſure</hi> than the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46828:10"/>former. Now we ſee <hi>darkly,</hi> as in a Glaſs, then face to face. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Now we drink of the Water of Life, as it runs in ſtreams, and as it is in the Ciſterns of Ordinances, and but a little at a time: Then we ſhall have a full draught of it at the Well-head. In a word, the Glory of Heaven is a conſtant High-Tide of Grace, exerciſed at the higheſt, and a conſtant High-Tide of the higheſt ſpiritual Enjoyments, that are enjoyable by created Beings. Heb. 11.9, 10. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>ſojourned in the Land of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange Country, dwelling in Tabernacles with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>Heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe; for he looked for a City with Foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which hath God for its Maker, is no increated Being; ſuch is the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Therefore,— That which hath Foundations, is no increated Being; ſuch is the heavenly City: Therefore,—That which hath an Architect and Builder, is no increated Being; ſuch is the heavenly City: Therefore,—That which is an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect proceeding from ſome other Cauſe, is no increated Being; ſuch is the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heaven: Therefore,—<hi>Matth.</hi> 20.23. <hi>To ſit on my right-hand, and on my left, is not mine to give; but it ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</hi> Matth. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi> John. 14.2, 3. <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions — I go to prepare a place for you; and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there you may be alſo.</hi> That which is <hi>prepared of God for Believers after this life,</hi> is no <hi>increated Being;</hi> ſuch is the Glory of Heaven: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, That which is given of God as an Inheritance, is no increated Being; ſuch is the Glory of Heaven: Therefore— I need ſay no more of this, only conclude with ſome Paſſages out of learned <hi>Norton,</hi> as Confirmation of what hath been aſſerted and proved: <hi>Orthod. Evang.</hi> p. 329. <hi>The beatifical Viſion is that clear ſight of God wherein conſiſteth Bleſſedneſs.</hi> It is called <hi>Viſion,</hi> becauſe of its <hi>clearneſs; Beatifical,</hi> becauſe it makes the ſeer <hi>bleſſed.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>created ſight of the increated Good.</hi> P. 133, 134. The light of Glory is a ſupernatural glorious influx, concurring with, and enabling of the inherent Principle of the glorified Underſtanding to ſee God. The Schoolmen ſay, <hi>Lumen Gloriae eſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio ſuperaddita, qua intellectus fit efficax, ſeu confortatur ad videndum Deum.</hi> The Light of Glory is a perfection ſuperadded to the Underſtanding, whereby it is enabled to ſee God. Others, <hi>Lumen Gloriae eſt actualis illuſtratio;</hi> i. e. <hi>Influxus Dei ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis elevans intellectum ad viſionem liſſentiae Divinae.</hi> It is an actual Illuſtration; <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſupernatural influx elevating the Underſtanding unto the Viſion of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Or, <hi>Lumen Gloriae eſt ipſe concurſus ſupernaturalis Beatifici objecti quatenus per illum objectum iſtud ſeipſum immediate intellectui manifeſat, efficiendo cum intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu beatificam viſionem.</hi> It is ſupernatural concourſe of the beatifical Object, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately manifeſting it ſelf to the Underſtanding, together with the Underſtanding cauſing a moſt bleſſed Viſion.</p>
            <p>God intending to make a Creature happy, gives it a Principle capable to <hi>underſtand</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> himſelf, the Object of that Principle to be underſtood and enjoyed. No Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of happineſs or miſery, but the reaſonable Creature: There could be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven nor Hell, the Joys of the one, nor the Pains of the other, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. A perfect union of the higheſt created Principle with the increated Object, makes Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>The laſt Argument I ſhall mention, is this: If inherent Grace be an increated Being, it is either the habit or exerciſe of Grace that is ſo; but neither of theſe is an increated Being: Therefore,—</p>
            <p>The habit of Grace is infuſed into the Soul by the Spirit of God; it is a Work of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46828:11"/>Holy Ghoſt; being infuſed into the Soul, it cannot continue its exiſtence there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out freſh recruits and ſupplies from above; it cannot put forth it ſelf into act, without ſome ſpecial aſſiſting influences from him that planted it there at firſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Therefore it is not the habit of Grace that is an increated Being.</p>
            <p>It is not Grace in its exerciſe that is an increated Being; for that is <hi>only an act of the Soul, ſanctified by the Spirit of God;</hi> and as ſuch, it hath always ſome imperfection at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, till we get to Heaven; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 12, 13, 14. I ſhall here omit ſeveral things that might pertinently be brought under this head, and only ſpeak to ſome particular Graces as they are acted by us, and ſhall leave it to the whole religious and rational Univerſe to judge, whether any thing that's acted by us, can be an increated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>What is the Grace of <hi>Repentance</hi> but a ſanctified Soul's exerciſing a <hi>godly Sorrow</hi> for all known Sins paſt, together with <hi>ſincere, fixed purpoſes, and effectual endeavours</hi> by <hi>divine aſſiſtances, to forſake ſin for time to come?</hi> Pſal. 51.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The Grace of <hi>Faith</hi> is an act of a ſanctified Soul, giving a credential aſſent to every known Scripture-Truth; eſpecially to that great fundamental Truth, That there is no Salvation for Sinners, but by the Son of God, apprehended, applied, and believed in; <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. It is to receive him as our All, and to reſign up our ſelves to him in all we are and have; <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>The Grace of <hi>Love</hi> is the Soul's going out after God with the moſt intenſe Deſires, after the cloſeſt Union and Communion that is attainable on this ſide Heaven; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7. <hi>John</hi> 21.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humility</hi> is the Soul's being exceeding low in its own eyes, and not thinking of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above what is meet; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Patience</hi> is the Soul's bearing all Afflictions, as coming from the Lord, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring or repining; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 39.8. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.9. <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> is a patient expectation of God's performing his gracious Promiſes, with holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to wait upon him, and keep his way, though for ſome time he delay to make good his Word; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24, 25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That this may be as a Nail driven to the head, and faſtened by the great Maſter of the Aſſemblies, I judge it neither impertinent nor unuſeful to preſent you with ſome weighty <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> which, by the Bleſſing of God, may keep every Man low in his own eyes, as long as he lives.</p>
            <p n="1">I. When Man was in his beſt eſtate at firſt, endowed with Knowledge, Wiſdom, and true Holineſs, there was even then a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of his Apoſtaſie: <hi>Impeccability</hi> was no part of his Eſſence; that is eſſential only to God. As <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>poſſe non peccare;</hi> ſo alſo there was a <hi>poſſe peccare:</hi> He was not placed ſo high, but he might fall, and that low enough. This ſhould have kept him low, and ſo it ſhould us to this day.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As often as we call to mind that that <hi>poſſibility</hi> was reduced into act, that's enough to humble us as long as the World laſts. That may remain a ſtanding Demonſtration to the Univerſe, That the beſt of Creatures is but a Creature at beſt; liable to ſin, and to br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>niſery upon it ſelf. Our Proto Parents did ſin in eating the forbidden fruit; and that ſin of theirs did virtually and interpretatively carry all ſin in it. It was <hi>monſtrous Ingrati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>e;</hi> it was the Creature's lifting up it ſelf againſt its Creator; it was queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of God's Word, and hearkning unto the Dictates of the Devil, the great Enemy of Mankind, and a Lyar from the beginning, rather than unto God, who is a great Lover of Mankind, and who is Veracity and Truth it ſelf. It was not only tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the Temptation, but alſo complying therewith, and yielding thereunto. It was the hazarding the loſs of all Temporals, Spirituals, and Eternals, for a Trifle, for a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46828:12"/>matter of Nothing, for an imaginary, not a real pleaſure: It was diſcontent with their preſent Condition, without any colour or ſhadow of Reaſon; their Sin was intolerable Pride: The Worm that was newly crept out of the Duſt, aſpired after a Deity; they muſt forſooth be like God, knowing good and evil; but by climbing too high, they got a fall. <hi>Curioſity</hi> was their Sin; they muſt pry into the Secrets of God, and meddle with matters too high for 'em. Wantonneſs was their Evil; though they had all the choice that Paradiſe afforded, yet their over-dainty Palates luſted after the forbidden Fruit. Sacrilege was their Sin; the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, was of a ſacramental and ſignificant Uſe; and to alienate Things ſacred to another uſe, than what they were inſtituted for, is a great profanation of the Ordinance of God. They were guilty of Murder in the higheſt degree, in murdering not only their own Bodies and Souls, but alſo the Bodies and Souls of the whole Race of Mankind. Preſumption was their Sin, they ventured to violate an expreſs divine Precept, preſuming that God would ſhew Mercy to them when they had ſo done.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The firſt Man became not only guilty of eating the forbidden Fruit, but alſo that act of his was imputable, and to be imputed to all that were in his Loins by natural Generation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one Man ſin entered into the World, and death by ſin.</hi> Verſ. 19. <hi>By one Man's Diſobedience many were made Sinners.
<note place="margin">Muſcul.</note> In Adamo omnes fuimus, in lumbis ejus.</hi> We were all in the Loins of offending <hi>Adam.</hi> As <hi>Levi</hi> is ſaid to have paid Tythes in <hi>Abraham</hi> before he was born, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>So we ſinned in</hi> Adam <hi>before we had a Being.

As ſoon as his Iſſue are in a Capacity to commit ſin, they do by their actings approve of what he did. The Language of their Lives, if not of their Lips, is this: If that which <hi>Adam</hi> did were to be done again, we would do it; and if we had been in his place, we ſhould have done the ſame as he did.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As in one all ſinned, and became liable to Death; ſo now we have ſin in our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> by propagation from our more <hi>immediate Parents.</hi> We come now from the Womb, not only diveſted of the Image of God, which we had in <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, but alſo inveſted with the Image of the evil One, which <hi>Adam</hi> and all our Parents have had ever ſince the Fall: No Toad is more full of Venom, nor Serpent of Poiſon, than our Nature is now of Sin: O how ſhould this cauſe us, with the Leper, to cry out, Unclean, unclean; we do even loath and abhorr our ſelves, that our Nature is ſo prone to that which is evil, and ſo averſe from that which is good: <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Nature being ſo deeply depraved in all, and Sin being propagated by Parents to Children, from Generation to Generation, it muſt neceſſarily follow from hence, That Sinners in their lapſed eſtate, can do nothing towards their Reſtoration, or Redemption, from that unfathomable Abyſs, and profound depth of Sin and Miſery, into which they have plunged themſelves. When Man comes from the Womb, he is the moſt helpleſs of all Animals, as to things of this Life, much more as to the things of a better Life: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly:</hi>

            <p n="8">VIII. When Man is told what God hath done in order to his Recovery, and what he is to do in order to his reaping the benefit and advantage of the Redemption wrought for him by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſuch is the blindneſs of his Mind, and perverſeneſs of his Will, that if left to himſelf, he chuſes rather to continue in Sin, than to be ſaved from it, and to reſt upon his own poor Services, Sacrifices, and Duties for Juſtification and Salvation, than upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Let this or ſome ſuch Doctrine as this be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Apoſtate Poſterity of <hi>Adam:</hi> Great was the Breach that Sin had made between God and you.

He being <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> how could <hi>Mercy</hi> be ſhewed to them, without <hi>impeachment</hi> to <hi>Juſtice?</hi> No Created Being was able to make ſatisfaction for the Wrong and Injury that was done; therefore a Sacrifice would not have been accepted from Angels nor from Man; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Guilt upon him, could not have ſtood before the Wrath of the Almighty; who, when Angry but a little, tears in pieces, and there is no delivering out of his Hand: And if neither Angels nor Men can make Atonement for Sin, much leſs can the reſt of the Creation: A Thouſand of Rams, and Ten thouſand Rivers of Oil, ſignifie nothing in this Caſe: The offended Party finds out a Ranſom, and accepts of the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. Tell them, that in and through Chriſt there is Grace and Mercy with God for the greateſt of Sinners, if they are found <hi>truly repenting of Sin,</hi> and <hi>believing on the Lord Jeſus.

Tell them, if they ſay they have no power to repent or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. God hath exalted his Son to be a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>a Saviour,</hi> to <hi>give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion of Sin;</hi> and <hi>Faith is the Gift of God, Eph</hi> 2.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me all the Ends of the Earth, and be ſaved.</hi> Grace is in your offer; be not ſo fooliſh as to refuſe your own Mercies; this is the accepted time, this is the day of Salvation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Conſider the things that belong to your Peace, while your day of Grace laſts, leaſt afterwards it be too late, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42.— Who would think but rational Beings, indued with immortal Souls, which will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally miſerable or happy, will effectually mind that which is indiſputably both their Duty and Intereſt, having all this and much more laid before them: Sure they will now for ever <hi>abandon every known Sin,</hi> and <hi>reſign up themſelves entirely to the Conduct of Chriſt:</hi> But, alas, alas, here is matter of Lamentation; the King of Glory knocks at our Door, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. but who opens for him to come in? He ſtretches out his Hand all day long to a rebellious, ſtiff-necked People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4. and 53.1. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6—<hi>Matth.</hi> 22.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. When Sinners are left to the Corruptions of their own Hearts, they are not only ſo fooliſh as to ſlight the offers of Grace, but alſo ſo deſperately wicked, as to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all their might <hi>againſt the Goſpel,</hi> and the propagation of it. They will by no means admit that Chriſt ſhould reign over themſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. As far as in them lies, he ſhall not reign in others. They enter not into the Kingdom of Heaven them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46828:14"/>they ſuffer not others to enter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.13. They perſecute them that <hi>preach, profeſs,</hi> and <hi>practiſe the Goſpel</hi> with any Seriouſneſs. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51, 52, 57, 58, 59. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Nature is now ſo deeply depraved in all, that nothing ſhort of an effectual Work of the Holy Ghoſt can renew, ſanctifie, and change it: This is a Work too high for Nature improved to the utmoſt; Nature cannot produce a Supernatural Effect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Education</hi> can conſiderably accompliſh Nature, but they cannot new make it. When there is no more than mere Humane Inſtitution and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they cannot cauſe all old things to paſs away, and all things to become new. This is too high for the moſt refined Philoſophy, ancient, or modern, taught by <hi>Socrates, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> It is not Academical Learning can reach this: It is not being under the moſt powerful and Spiritual Miniſtry: It is not the moſt Argumentative Moral Swaſions made uſe of by Men: It is not a Man's own Deſires, Endeavours, Reſolutions, Promiſes, Vows, Covenants and Engagements, to forſake all and every Sin: It is not being in the external Practice of all Religious Duties: It is not being of this or t'other Perſuaſion, ſubmitting to this or t'other Ordinance, being of this or t'other Church, and receiving the Sacrament, that changes Nature: For all theſe things may be, where there is no Heart-Renovation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto thee, except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> had a Notion, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſo Iſraeli eſt portio in mundo futuro, hoc eſt, in fruitione Meſſiae, nec omnino neceſſariam eſſe animi renovationem.</hi> They thought their being the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> without being renewed in the Spirit of their mind, would entitle them to the Fruition of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Chriſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects this Miſtake of theirs, and inſtructs them of the <hi>neceſſity of Regeneration.</hi> A Soul-ſanctifying Work of the Holy Ghoſt muſt paſs upon you here, if ever you hope for the Glory of Heaven hereafter. The ſame Truth is reiterated <hi>ver.</hi> 5. that <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> and all others concerned, might take the more ſpecial notice thereof, till it be impreſſed upon their Hearts, and till they know it in their own Experience. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit, i. e. ex Spiritu exerente vim Aquae, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> There is nothing ſhort of the <hi>Divine Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> can <hi>cleanſe Souls</hi> polluted with Sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. They that are <hi>Spiritually dead,</hi> and in an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Eſtate, can no more change their Natures, than they that are in the Grave can give themſelves a Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There are ſuch Acts of Omnipotence exerted and put forth in the Work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as was put forth in raiſing Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Even after the Spirit of God hath been effectually at work upon the Soul, and hath infuſed Supernatural Habits of <hi>Saving Grace,</hi> there is that which may ſtill keep him humble and low in his own Eyes. Many particulars might be mentioned under this Head; but I ſhall content my ſelf with mentioning only a few.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Notwithſtanding the Spirit of God hath been effectually at work upon the Soul, there is not preſently an utter extirpation of Sin, <hi>Grace</hi> is not without ſome mixture of Nature, there is <hi>Fleſh</hi> as well as <hi>Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8, 10. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though where true Grace is, it will make reſiſtance againſt in-dwelling Sin, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the latter may have the better of the former; Grace may be over-poured by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46828:14"/>and that does often create no ſmall diſturbance to a gracious Perſon. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23, 24.—<hi>I ſee another Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of Sin—O wretched Man that I am—</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>cerumnoſus—i.e. perpetuis in iſta lucta angori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus divexatus;</hi> The Combats and Conflicts which I have with the Corruptions of mine own Heart do create me a continual Vexation and Anguiſh of Soul. <hi>Perſiſtet in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphora Athletae, qui poſt gravem luctam tandem nolens volens captivus ducitur;</hi> He perſiſts in the Metaphor of a Wreſtler, who after a great Conteſt, is at laſt carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way captive by force, and ſore againſt his Will.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Even they that have true Grace may, in an hour of Temptation, and when left to themſelves, fall into ſome hainous and ſcandalous Sin, whereby the Spirit of God is grieved, peace of Conſcience interrupted, Communion with God loſt, Religion wounded, and all ſorts, good and bad, ſcandalized: <hi>Noah, Lot, David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> are ſad Inſtances for the Exemplification of this Aſſertion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.30, 31, 32, 33. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. and 12. <hi>Chap. Matt.</hi> 26.69.—to the end of the Chapter. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Wherefore let him that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall. Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith, be not high-minded, but fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When a Man hath fallen into a ſcandalous Sin, it is not all the Grace he hath that will recover him to Repentance, or reſtore to him the Holy Joys and Spiritual Comforts which he once had: There muſt be ſome freſh Manifeſtations of Sin-pardoning Grace, together with ſome freſh Influences of the Spirit accompanying the ſame: It will be like to coſt him many a Tear and Prayer before he re-enjoy that ſweet Communion which once he had; there muſt be a renewed exerciſe of Repentance. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. throughout: <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, according unto the multitude of thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies, blot out my Tranſgreſſions. Waſh me throughly from my Iniquity, and cleanſe me from my Sin: For I acknowledge my Tranſgreſſion; and my Sin is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.—Make me to hear joy and gladneſs; that the Bones which thou haſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken may rejoice—Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation; and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Though ſome may have a great deal of <hi>Grace,</hi> yet they may be exerciſed with divine Deſertion to that degree, that the moſt comfortable Conſiderations that can be ſuggeſted to them from the Scriptures, by the moſt Holy and Learned Miniſters, and moſt experienced Chriſtians, can adminiſter no Conſolation to their Spirits, till the Lord himſelf come and do it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2, 3 —<hi>My Soul refuſed to be comforted— ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88, throughout. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Job</hi> 6.4 <hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are within me; the Poiſon whereof drinketh up my Spirit.

            <p n="6">6. Though <hi>Grace</hi> is a great Excellence, it does not <hi>exempt</hi> perſons that have it from Afflictions; during their Pilgrimage here, the great Sovereign afflicts the Good as well as the Bad, <hi>Job</hi> 9.22. <hi>He deſtroys the Perfect and the Wicked, Jer.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35. <hi>Job</hi> 9.12. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. Nay, many times they that are God's pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ones, his ſpecial Favourites, are afflicted more than others, <hi>Amos</hi> 3 2. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. They have that in them which may procure the Rod now and then, and it is needful they ſhould have it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. It is to humble them under a Senſe of ſome Sin or other, not throughly repented of, <hi>Job</hi> 36.7, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. It is to purge out ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46828:15"/>peccant Humours that have been predominant in their Souls, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.9. and 4.4. It is to make them walk more cloſe with God for time to come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67, 71. and to make them partakers of his Holineſs in ſome further meaſure and degree, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10, 11. It is to make them pray oftner and better than they were wont to do, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.16. and 38.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.5, 6, and 116.1, 2, 3— It is to endear the Word of the Lord to them, to make them ſtudy the Covenant of Grace, and the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof, to make ſure their Intereſt therein, and that they may live the Life of Faith more than ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 9 49, 50, 72, 92. <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. Afflictions of the Godly are Evidences of Divine Love, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. It is to wean them more from this World, to fit them for Death, and prepare them for Eternity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37, 38, 39. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All the <hi>Grace</hi> that Men have, doth not <hi>privilege</hi> the <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi> thereof from being obnoxious to the Aſſaults of <hi>Satan;</hi> yea, by Divine Permiſſion, he may for ſome time ſeveral ways prevail againſt them. Hence it is that we are exhorted to be ſober and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, becauſe our Adverſary, the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour, <hi>whom we are to reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>To be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; to put on the whole Armour of God, that we may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Devil: For we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, againſt the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt Spiritual Wickedneſs in High Places— above all taking the Shield of Faith, whereby we ſhall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked One,</hi> Eph. 6.10, 11, 12, 13-16. The Lord does for holy and wiſe ends ſometimes give a kind of a providential Commiſſion to Satan againſt this, and the other Servant of his; and then he will not be wanting to do his worſt againſt 'em; when once he receives ſuch Power, he will inſtantly improve it to their diſadvantage. <hi>Job</hi> 2.8. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, Behold all that he hath is in thy power</hi>—and 2.6. <hi>Behold he is in thine hand</hi>—Let me ſhew you in ſome Particulars how far by Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the power of the evil One may extend it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He may not only <hi>tempt</hi> them to <hi>Sin,</hi> but alſo draw them to a compliance with the <hi>Temptation</hi> and <hi>Bait</hi> that he lays for 'em: His common Method is firſt to tempt to Preſumption, and then to deſpair, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 7, 11. He ſollicited our <hi>Proto</hi>-Parents to fin, and ceaſed not till he accompliſhed his Deſign, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4—He put it into the heart of <hi>David</hi> to number the People, when there was no occaſion for any ſuch thing, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1—for which his own heart ſmote him after he had done it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. and the Lord was diſpleaſed with him for it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.14. He made him ſenſible that he could quickly leſſen their number; and, accordingly, in Three Days time there were 70000 of them cut off by the Plague, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He may, for ſome time, <hi>hinder the Work of the Lord</hi> in the Hands of them that are eminent for Grace and Holineſ. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>We would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</hi> He did all he could to obſtruct the Propagation of the Goſpel by my Miniſtry; and all the Grace I had was little enough to countermine his Contrivances, Projects, and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Devil hath a great hand in ſowing the Seeds of Errors; and all the Grace, whether of Miniſters or People, proves of ſmall efficacy to hinder this Helliſh Work of his. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. <hi>The Serpent caſt out of his mouth Water as a Flood, after the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the Flood.</hi> After the Chriſtians were delivered from their bloody Perſecutions under the Heathen Emperors, <hi>Arrianiſm</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46828:15"/>came in as a Torrent upon them; and this Enemy had a hand in it. Antichriſtianiſm is a Sink of Errors, and it had its Original from <hi>the bottomleſs Pit, Rev.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's coming is after the working of Satan, <hi>with all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders, and with all deceiveableneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſ 2 9, 10. Though there have been many famous both for Piety and Learning, who have bore a faithful Teſtimony againſt the Errors of Antichriſt; yet by the Devil's Adiſtance he hath got great Footing in the World, and hath continued along time, to advance his Kingdom and Intereſt among them that bear the Name of Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3, 4, 5. <hi>All the World wondred after the Beaſt, and they worſhipped the Dragon which gave power to the Beaſt; and they worſhipped the Beaſt, ſaying, Who is like unto the Beaſt? Who is able to make War with him? And there was given unto him a mouth ſpeaking great Things, and Blaſphemies, and Power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As the Devil is very active and induſtrious to ſow the Seeds of Error among the Sons of Men; ſo alſo ſuch is his Subtilty, Cunning, Craft, and Art in deceiving, that ſome that are of the <hi>Churches of Chriſt may be infected therewith,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.14. <hi>He tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himſelf into an Angel of Light:</hi> He repreſents this or t'other <hi>Error</hi> as ſome <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. He may, by divine Permiſſion, have power over the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Perſons. Job</hi> was ſuch a Man, that there was none like him in the Earth, <hi>perfect and upright, one that feared God and eſchewed Evil,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 8. And yet all his Grace did not ſecure his Subſtance from falling into the hands of the Devil, and thoſe that were acted by him. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. 19. After once the Lord had ſaid, <hi>All that he hath is in thy power,</hi> waſting and deſtruction quickly followed thereupon: The Oxen and the Aſſes are carried away by the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> and the Servants that look'd to them ſlain: Fire from Heaven falls upon the Sheep and the Servants, and conſumes them: The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> fell upon the Camels, and made a Prey of them; a terrible Tempeſt blows down the Houſe where his Children were, and kills them all.</p>
            <p n="6">6 The Devil may ſcare gracious Perſons with frightful Dreams, nocturnal Viſions; and Apparitions. <hi>Job</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>When I ſay, my Bed ſhall comfort me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Couch ſhall eaſe my Complaint; then thou ſcareſt me with Dreams, and terrifieſt me through Viſions:</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46828:16"/>Humour which is now ſo fixed in me, and predominant over me, or from the Devil's Malice, who by thy Permiſſion diſturbs me in this manner, that I am afraid to go to ſleep, and my Remedy proves as bad as my Diſeaſe. <hi>Thou ſcareſt me</hi>—The Word ſignifies, ſays <hi>Caryl, To be caſt down proſtrate to the Ground with Fear.</hi> From the Diſeaſe and Sickneſs of <hi>Job</hi>'s Body, <hi>Satan</hi> took occaſion to raiſe Fumes, and ſtir the pudled Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his Body up into his Brain; out of which his Fancy formed terrible Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations to his Mind. As Melancholy is ſaid to be the Devil's Bath, ſo are other diſeaſed ſickly Humours; in them he ſports himſelf and vexes Man—As before when <hi>Satan</hi> by his Inſtruments took away all from him, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord taketh.</hi> So here, when <hi>Satan</hi> vexed him with Viſions, repreſenting horrid and fearful Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; yet he ſays, <hi>Thou ſcareſt me</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The Devil may have Power over the Bodies of gracious Perſons to move them in a ſhort time from one place to another. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.1. Chriſt was in the Wilderneſs; from thence Satan took him up into the Holy City, and ſet him on a Pinacle of the Temple: <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and from thence to an exceeding high Mountain—<hi>ver.</hi> 8. Here was a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not a treble remove: And if he had ſo much Power over the Body of our bleſſed Redeemer, much more over the Bodies of them that belong to him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He may torment the Bodies of Saints, and put them to a great deal of Pain. <hi>Job</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, Behold he is in thine hand, only ſave his Life, So went Satan forth from the Preſence of the Lord, and ſmote Job with ſore Boils, from the Sole of his Foot unto the Crown of his Head. And he took him a Potſherd to scrape himſelf withal; and he ſat down among the Aſhes.</hi> No ſooner hath he his Commiſſion but he puts it in execution inſtantly without delay. <hi>He ſmote Job</hi>— The word, ſays <hi>Caryl,</hi> ſignifies <hi>to ſtrike unto Death:</hi> It notes both the ſuddenneſs and vehemency of the Stroke; it muſt at once wound both his Mind and his Body, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in a Moment, to be filled with Sores, and covered with a Scab and Boils. The Word ſignifies <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>leus ex calore ortum &amp; igne, inflammans corpus;</hi> he did as it were kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a Fire in the Bowels of <hi>Job,</hi> inflamed his Blood, and heated the humours of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Vox Hebraea ſignificat ſcabiem foediſſimam, qualis eſt Elephantiaſis;</hi> He ſmote him with a moſt filthy Scab, ſuch as is the Leproſie, with the worſt and moſt torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Boils; no part of his Body was free, only his Tongue was untouch'd, that it might be at liberty to blaſpheme God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. All the Grace that Men have is not able to keep the Devil from entring into their Bodies, and taking Poſſeſſion of them, if he hath permiſſion from God. Among ſo many <hi>Demoniacks</hi> and poſſeſſed Perſons that we read of in the New Teſtament, it is more than probable there were ſome had good in them, and were Objects of God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour. Chriſt not only wrought miraculous Cures on ſuch, but he preached the Goſpel alſo where they were; whereby we may underſtand, that he bleſſed them both with Temporal and Spiritual Bleſſings. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.23, 24. and 8.16, 17. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.28, 29, 30, 31, 32. and 9.32, 33. and 12.22. <hi>Mark</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.39. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7, 8. and 10.38. and 16.16, 17, 18. and 19.11, 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. We read of few that were poſſeſs'd under the old Teſtament: But when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came into the World, the Devil raged more than before, and God ſuffered it to be ſo, that all might have a Demonſtration of the Divinity of Chriſt, of his great love to the Souls and Bodies of the Sinners of Mankind, and that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> might be convinced of that fooliſh Opinion of theirs, That there were no Spirits, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.8.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46828:16"/>
            <p n="10">10. The Devil may have Power to kill the Bodies of them that have Grace. We are bound to judge charitably of <hi>Job</hi>'s Children; to be ſure ſo good a Man as he gave them Religious Education; he inſtilled good Principles into them in their younger days; he pray'd for a Bleſſing on the means made uſe of for begetting Grace in them; and yet the Devil killed them all at once, <hi>Job</hi> 1.19. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into Priſon:</hi> And it is paſt all peradventure, the Cruelty and inhumane Uſage which ſome of the impriſoned ones had there from the Agents of the Evil One, put a Period to their Days. As he hath been a Murderer from the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>John</hi> 8.44. ſo chiefly of the Saints and Servants of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. <hi>It was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Beaſt to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them</hi>—And by whom is this Beaſt acted? From whom doth he receive his Commiſſion to be in Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt the Saints? <hi>ver.</hi> 2. — <hi>The Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and his Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee, that though Grace is one of the greateſt of created Excellencies, yet it hath not that in it which can ſecure the Proprietors and Poſſeſſors thereof from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the Power of the Devil as to the forementioned particulars.</p>
            <p>It were eaſie to enlarge here, and to give you many more humbling Conſiderations, but I am minded to draw towards a Cloſe, and therefore ſhall barely and briefly name a few things more, of which I may appeal to the Experience of moſt Gracious Perſons.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling</hi> to you, That notwithſtanding of what Grace you have, you are ſtill ſo prone to Sin upon every Temptation?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That you have ſinned ſo often without any Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from without? Does not Sin within you ever and anon bubble up, when neither the Devil nor the World eggs you on; you are apt to ſin faſt enough of your own Accord?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That you have ſo often caſt your ſelves upon Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation without a Call? When Temptations have not offered themſelves, you have ſought for them, and have thereby provoked the Holy One to give you up to the Luſts of your own Hearts, and to the Power of the Evil One.</p>
            <p>Have you not too too often <hi>quenched and grieved the Spirit of God,</hi> aſter he hath been at work upon your Spirits, enlightning and enlivening you, quickning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting you? After he hath drawn out your Affections to be in a Holy Flame of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Love to the Lord Jeſus, you have thrown Water upon this Fire that he hath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in you.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling</hi> to you, That you have ſo often ſinned againſt light and Knowledge, That you have acted contrary to the Dictates and Convictions of your own Conſciences?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That you have ſo often ſilenced Conſcience, and lulled it aſleep, when it was about to lay your Sin before you in all the Aggravations thereof? You have been but little in that All, in that neceſſary Duty of <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>-examination;</hi> and when you have gone about it, you have not been ſo thorough therein as you ſhould have been: when Conſcience hath been ready to bring in an impartial Verdict as to the preſent State of your Souls, have ye not flattered your ſelves, as if all might go well enough with you notwithſtanding of your living in the neglect and omiſſion of ſome Duties, and your taking too much Latitude as to ſome Sins?</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:46828:17"/>
            <p>It is not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That you Hearts have ſo often deceived you? Have you not often and often thought, that ſuch a particular Luſt had been ſo mortified, that you ſhould never have heard of it any more; and yet ye have been miſtaken?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That the Sin which doth ſo eaſily beſet you, hath given you ſo much diſturbance, that it hath taken you off from ſo many a good Work, which otherwiſe ye would have been about? It hath diſtracted your Spirits when you have been in Duties; it hath led you into many a ſinful Snare, out of which ye have not been able to extricate your ſelves without difficulty; it hath ſet you back in your way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and hath hindred your growing in Grace; it hath much interrupted your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and cauſed an eclipſe of the Light of his Countenance; ſo that you have not had the bright Shinings thereof, as otherwiſe you might have had.</p>
            <p>May it not be <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That your Humiliation hath not been proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to your Sins and Provocations? You have had a long time of ſinning, but your Sorrow hath been of a ſhort continuance: You have ſinned greatly, and have ſorrowed but little. It is but ſeldom ye have offered up to God that excellent Sacrifice of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Heart, and a contrite Spirit.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That ye have miſ-ſpent ſo much precious time? Some part of it hath been ſpent in Idleneſs, doing nothing; ſome in ſinning; ſome in doing that which ſignifies little for Soul-advantage.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That ye have proſited ſo little by all the Ordinances that have been adminiſtred to you time after time, and by all the Providences of this day in general, and towards your ſelves in particular? Is there not cauſe to ſay, <hi>Ab, our leanneſs, our leanneſs,</hi> notwithſtanding of the many Soul-fructifying Seaſons of Grace we have had? See <hi>Luke</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.69.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> that you have lived ſo long in the World, and have been ſo little ſerviceable to the Son of God, who gave himſelf unto death for you; and that you have been ſo little uſeful unto others in the places where you have been ſet?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That your Ignorance of Divine things is ſo great, and your Knowledge ſo ſmall; that ye have been for ſo long a time Learners in the School of Chriſt; and yet the things whereof ye are ignorant, are more than the things you know? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That ye have manifeſted ſo much imprudence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion in managing your ſecular Concerns? Have ye not in many things leaned too much to your own Underſtanding, whereby your Wiſdom hath appeared to be Folly? Have ye hearkned to <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6, 7?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That notwithſtanding of all your Gifts and Graces, Piety and Prudence, you cannot prevent Diſappointments, Croſſes, Loſſes, Troubles, and Tryals in the World; neither can you give Succeſs to your Undertakings or Actings? <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong; neither yet Bread to the Wiſe; nor yet Riches to Men of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding; but time and chance happeneth to them all, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That notwithſtanding all the Grace ye have, you are ſo often put to a <hi>non-plus</hi> in your own Thought that you know not what to do? When ye have conſulted your ſelves, conſidered all Circumſtances, hearkned to whatſoever that within you can ſuggeſt, yet ye find cauſe enough ſtill for your going unto others for Counſel and Advice; and when ye have been with them, and have all they can ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, you come away as wiſe as ye went?</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:46828:17"/>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> that ye are ſo variable, ſickle, uncertain, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? One hour ſeemingly fix'd in your Reſolves to do ſo and ſo; next hour unreſolved again: Love to day, hate to morrow: One Week on the Mount with the moſt High; If all forſake thee I never will; next Week at the Foot of the Mount; Grace at as low an Ebb as well it can be. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That ye have ſo often adminiſtred occaſion to the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and Wicked to ſpeak evil of the pure Religion which ye profeſs and of thoſe Holy Ways in which ye Walk, that ye have no more adorned the Doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with a Converſation in all things according to the Goſpel; and that ye have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſadned the Spirits of thoſe whom God would not have ſadned? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That ye are no more humbled for the Sins of others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom ye live? God is diſhonoured at a high rate every where; Prophaneneſs is countenanced and encouraged in moſt places; all ſeriouſneſs in Religion is ridiculed: They whoſe Work it ſhould be to take People off their Sins, and to put them in a fair Way for Heaven and Glory, are ſo far from minding the Converſion of Sinners, and the Salvation of Souls, that they do what in them lies to obſtruct whatever hath a Tendency hereunto; They neither enter into the Kingdom of Heaven themſelves, nor ſuffer others to enter. They that ſhould impartially execute Juſtice and Righteouſneſs between Man and Man, do no ſuch thing, but rather the contrary; they patronize Impiety, and are a Terrour to them that do well—and yet, ah, How few are there who lay theſe things to Heart? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That there is ſo little of a truly publick Spirit in this day of ours, even among thoſe that profeſs themſelves Followers of the Lamb, the Lord Jeſus? Every one minds his own things few or none the things of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. There is little of a true Zeal for God and his Glory and againſt Sin, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That you have ſo little of a true hearty Love for all that do viſibly bear the Image of Chriſt, That there is ſo little of Love among thoſe that have all one Father, one Redeemer, one Sanctifier, that are all the Objects of God's ſpecial Love and Favour, that do all walk by the ſame Rule, according to the meaſure of Light and Knowledge received, that are all one in the Great and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths of the Goſpel, that are all in good earneſt for Holineſs here, and do hope for the ſame Heaven, and Glory hereafter?</p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>matter of humbling,</hi> That you live not every day as if it were to be your laſt day? That your thoughts are ſo little taken up about the Glory you are going to in the other World; and that ye are not at all times like unto them that look for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord? <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35, 36.—2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.6, 7, 8</p>
            <p>Theſe are only Generals; I have ſpoke ſomewhat largely of theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p>If you would admit of a due, thorough, and impartial Conſideration, how much Sin is in your Thoughts, that would humble you?</p>
            <p>If you would take a view of all your <hi>Words,</hi> you could not but acknowledge in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we offend all. And <hi>If any Man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect Man, and able alſo to bria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If you would call to mind the Sinfulneſs that adheres to your Affections, you would ſee cauſe with the Leper under the Law, to cry out, <hi>

            </p>
            <p>If you would but as near as you can, remember all your Omiſſions, and how you have left the Good undone, which ye ought, and might have done.</p>
            <p>If you would make Reflections on that little good you have done, together with the manifold Defects, ſinful Failings and Infirmities that hath attended you therein.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:46828:18"/>

            <p>If you would lay to Heart the Guilt which you have contracted, and do daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in managing the Duties of your Callings.</p>
            <p>And, laſtly, If you would narrowly look into your Relative Sins, as Parents, as Children, as Husbands, as Wives, as Maſters, as Servants—you will ſee enough and enough that might cauſe you ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3, 4. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark Iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand But there is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why I paſs over the many particulars contained under the pre-mentioned Heads is, becauſe I would not ſwell this ſmall Piece to a greater Price than the Purſe of thoſe that deſire to be ſatisfied in this Point, can conveniently reach.</p>
            <p>Thus you have had the firſt Improvement of this Truth. It concerns you to be well grounded in the Belief of this. That the Grace of God in Believers is no Increated, but a Created Being, as that which would conduce much to the keeping you very humble, and everlaſtingly low in your own Eyes.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now come to a ſecond Improvement of this, which is alſo a very genuine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from the Premiſſes; and that is, If true Grace in Believers be a Creature, yea, a weak and imperfect Creature, without a continued Communication of freſh Influences every moment from the Original and Creator thereof; then it is as clear as the Sun in the Meridian, that <hi>John Eliots</hi> muſt be in a great Error, in that Piece which he hath publiſhed; Called, <hi>The Saving Grace of God</hi>—which he aſſerts to be in All Men; and to be an Increated Being, with more Confidence than ſtrength of Reaſon. If that within him teaches ſuch falſe Doctrine as this; and hath committed ſo great a miſtake, as to put him upon writing on this Subject, when ſo meanly qualified for this Service, this is a Caution to all to beware of this Principle of his: It hath made him think that he was in a Capacity of confuting holy and learned <hi>Flavel.</hi> But I have drawn up another ſhort Tract, to demonſtrate. That his pretended Anſwer both to him and me, is no Anſwer at all: It will be his Wiſdom to be ſilent; if not, he muſt thank himſelf, if in the Second he have more plain Dealing than in this. They that are of his Perſwaſion will ſee what a weak Advocate they have to plead their Cauſe: And if they are not above all Advice from others, I humbly offer it, as a thing worthy of their ſerious Conſideration, whether <hi>this Principle</hi> in many that have <hi>profeſs'd</hi> and <hi>Practiſed</hi> it ſince the Year 1653, hath not been attended with many <hi>humbling Providences,</hi> which call for a deep Humiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, rather than that <hi>J. E.</hi> ſhould after all be ſtill <hi>over and above magnifying</hi> that <hi>within him and others,</hi> as an <hi>Increated Being.</hi> I have been all my days a Man of a <hi>peaceable Spirit,</hi> and would fain continue at Peace with all as much as in me lies without Sin: It is ſome <hi>extraordinary provocation</hi> draws me into the Field. If he writes any more, he will know that I am better <hi>acquainted</hi> with the <hi>Writings and Works</hi> of theſe Men than he is aware; he may be like to hear of many things that may not pleaſe him: I can give him a <hi>large Account</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of <hi>G Fox, Ja. Naylor,</hi> and others; I can tell him that the Actings of ſome of their <hi>Principal Leaders,</hi> have been a <hi>practical Confutation</hi> of the <hi>Grand Principle,</hi> That every Man hath that within him, which is ſufficient without any thing elſe, to teach, inſtruct, lead, guide, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46828:18"/>direct him. For <hi>G. Fox</hi> penned down Orders to be obſerved by every one; and they that did not obſerve them, were <hi>cenſurable,</hi> and to be <hi>diſowned,</hi> as not in the <hi>
